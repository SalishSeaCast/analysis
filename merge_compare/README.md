The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made for comparing NEMO 3.6 and 3.4 simulations.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[mergeCompare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/merge_compare/mergeCompare.ipynb)  
    
    Comparing merge-tests between 3.4 and 3.6. Day long simulation.
