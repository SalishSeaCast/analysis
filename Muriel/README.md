The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Muriel for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Exploring Model Data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Model Data.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used for some basic exploration on modelled data.  

* ##[Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will explore model data at the Ocean Networks Canada(ONC) VENUS nodes.   
      
    Information about the ONC VENUS nodes can be found here:

* ##[Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to evaluate the model velocities at the VENUS nodes and compare them to the ADCP daoly plots generated by the VENUS nodes.
