The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Muriel for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[EllipsesSensitivityToTimeSeries.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/EllipsesSensitivityToTimeSeries.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to test the sensitivity of tidal ellipses from the model output based on data series variations such as length, frequency and seasonality.  

* ##[ellipseModule.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/ellipseModule.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to redesign the tidal ellipse functions to make them more user friendly  

* ##[CODAREllipse.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/CODAREllipse.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will look at the ellipses and the phase at the CODAR region.  

* ##[Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to create functions that will show the daily veocity plots with data that ahs been calculated every 15 minutes at the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[SaveTidalParameters.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/SaveTidalParameters.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to save the tidal parameters calculated from the model output to a csv file in order to avoid having to load all the files run.  

* ##[ThalwegEllipses.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/ThalwegEllipses.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook's purpose is to visualise the tidal ellipses along the thalweg.  

* ##[UsingEllipse.py.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/UsingEllipse.py.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to show some functions in ellipse.py and maximize the accessibility of this module.  

* ##[DailyComparisonPlots.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/DailyComparisonPlots.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to create the plots that will do daily comparisons of the model to ONC VENUS nodes.  

* ##[TidalEllipsesComparisons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/TidalEllipsesComparisons.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook has the purpose of comparing tidal ellipses calculated by the model to other data sources.  

* ##[JuandeFucaEllipses.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/JuandeFucaEllipses.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to look at and understand the model output currents through Juan de Fuca with the use of ellipses  

* ##[Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to evaluate the model velocities at the VENUS nodes and compare them to the ADCP daoly plots generated by the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to test the research_VENUS.py module.  

* ##[TidalEllipseTools.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/TidalEllipseTools.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will use the tidal ellipse calculating functions on simple cases.  

* ##[HaroStraitEllipses.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/HaroStraitEllipses.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to look at and understand the model output currents through Haro Strait with the use of ellipses
