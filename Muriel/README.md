The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Muriel for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to test the research_VENUS.py module.  

* ##[ExploringNowcast_GreenOutputs-SWC.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/ExploringNowcast_GreenOutputs-SWC.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to look at plots from the nowcast_green runs  

* ##[SaveTidalParameters.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/SaveTidalParameters.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to save the tidal parameters calculated from the model output to a csv file in order to avoid having to load all the files run.  

* ##[Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to evaluate the model velocities at the VENUS nodes and compare them to the ADCP daoly plots generated by the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to create functions that will show the daily veocity plots with data that ahs been calculated every 15 minutes at the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[DailyComparisonPlots.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/DailyComparisonPlots.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to create the plots that will do daily comparisons of the model to ONC VENUS nodes.  

* ##[ExploringNowcast_GreenOutputs.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/ExploringNowcast_GreenOutputs.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to look at plots from the nowcast_green runs  

* ##[Testing-research_ferries.py.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Testing-research_ferries.py.ipynb)
