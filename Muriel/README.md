    This notebook will be used to compare the tidal ellipses from the model outputs to the ones generated by Mike Foreman's model in Foreman et al. (2004).  

* ##[Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will explore model data at the Ocean Networks Canada(ONC) VENUS nodes.   
      
    Information about the ONC VENUS nodes can be found here:  
    * http://venus.uvic.ca/
