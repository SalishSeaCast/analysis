The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Muriel for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Exploring Model Data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Model Data.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used for some basic exploration on modelled data.  

* ##[Exploring Tidal Ellipses at VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Tidal Ellipses at VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook willbe used to explore the tidal ellipses conversions and manipulation at the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Testing research_VENUS.py module.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook is used to test the research_VENUS.py module.  

* ##[Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring Model Output at the ONC VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will explore model data at the Ocean Networks Canada(ONC) VENUS nodes.   
      
    Information about the ONC VENUS nodes can be found here:  
    * http://venus.uvic.ca/  

* ##[Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Exploring VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to evaluate the model velocities at the VENUS nodes and compare them to the ADCP daoly plots generated by the VENUS nodes.  

* ##[Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Muriel/Velocity Plots Using 15min Data at VENUS nodes.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to create functions that will show the daily veocity plots with data that ahs been calculated every 15 minutes at the VENUS nodes.
