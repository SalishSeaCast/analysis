# File map for 28-Mar-2016 creation of analysis-doug repo
# from the Doug/ directory of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-doug repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-doug_filemap.txt MEOPAR/analysis MEOPAR/analysis-doug
