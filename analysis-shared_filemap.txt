# File map for 2-May-2016 creation of analysis-shared repo
# from the compare_stratification/, compare_tides/, merge_compare/
# directories of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-shared repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-shared_filemap.txt . ../analysis-shared
