The IPython Notebooks in this directory are evaluation of the
tide and storm surge results calculated by the Salish Sea NEMO model.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Nowcast Temp and Salinity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/Nowcast Temp and Salinity.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Stratification and Diffusion.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/Stratification and Diffusion.ipynb)  
    
    Comparison of first year of NEMO spin up with StratoGEM. Focus is on salinity.   

* ##[Smoothing Topography.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/Smoothing Topography.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to look at effect of smoothing topography on stratification  

* ##[SJdF_Profiles_interpolate.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/SJdF_Profiles_interpolate.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare Strait of Juan de Fuca model salinity with IOS data collected in 2013.  
      
    IOS data stored in:  
    /ocean/sallen/allen/research/MEOPAR/IOS_2003_CTD/2003-07/CTD  


* ##[DWR_smoothing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/DWR_smoothing.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares topography smoothed to 0.33 regular topo.  


* ##[STRATOGEM_profiles.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/compare_stratification/STRATOGEM_profiles.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare our spin-up to STRATOGEM profiles
