The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[WindRose.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/WindRose.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at the statistics of wind information by plotting wind rose diagram  

* ##[TransportEachRun.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/TransportEachRun.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at the alongshore, cross-starit transport of fresh water, total water amount of each run.  

* ##[MeanCurrent.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/MeanCurrent.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to evaluate mean current (only forced by river flow) during low river flow period by comparing with codar data.  

* ##[ImpactOfEachForcing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/ImpactOfEachForcing.ipynb)  
    
    * To investigate the impact of each forcing, i.e., river flow, tides, winds and Coriolis force on the plume properties and stratification.  

* ##[OnlyRiverMeanCurrent.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/OnlyRiverMeanCurrent.ipynb)  
    
    * In addition to comparing mean current of model results with codar by the same method, how about the idealized caseof mean current? That is, to run only with rivers, no tides, no weather. Two speculations of the potential results:  
      
    * 1 Only river mean flow is closer to codar, that indicates winds effects much of the mean currents in the previous way.  
    * 2 None of them is closer to codar, something else is still going on...  
    * 3 Analyze difference between only river and all conditions.  

* ##[NoCoriolisMeanCurrent.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/NoCoriolisMeanCurrent.ipynb)  
    
    * To check my four days mean current without Coriolis force.  

* ##[HindcastSalCurrField.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/HindcastSalCurrField.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to check the difference between short vs long river in the salinity and currents field in the hourly results. This work is motivated by the high value of min salinity in 3.6 with long river(TS4) vs TS2, which we speculate it may be either caused by intense vertical mixing or relatively low river flow at the mouth with long river (mass conservation). However, I don't quite believe that results and think if it is mainly caused by low river flow at the mouth, it seems to contradict with the baseline we have stronger currents field with long river even taken into account the tidal currents. What if that 3.6 daily results did not count in the tidal part as it resolves the tidal component. Here, in 3.4, with hourly results, I want to examine the same issue with short and long river and see if this makes diffrence.  

* ##[Restart vs ColdStart.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/Restart vs ColdStart.ipynb)  
    
    * Spin-up determination  

* ##[Rmix.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/Rmix.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook is to investigate why mixing region sho up in the near field and north of the river mouth at low tides rather than high tides.  

* ##[TidesWindsFOct2014.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/TidesWindsFOct2014.ipynb)  
    
    * To investigate the forcings on stratification and total currents.   

* ##[RmixStatistics.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/RmixStatistics.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to do some statistics of to which degree each forcing mechanism contribute to the vertical mixing in different plume region.  

* ##[HigherVisMeanCurrent.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/HigherVisMeanCurrent.ipynb)  
    
    * To compare effect of viscosity in the mean current.  

* ##[TSforMay2015.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/surface_current/TSforMay2015.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to create TS initial files based on 21apr15 to spinup for May2015.
