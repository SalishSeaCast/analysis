The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to reproduce drifter track with reference of Nancy's notebook with longitude ticks shown completely in the figure.  

* ##[MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook was made to compare more drifter-model results, with new river channel, reduced viscosty, no_banks and reduced viscosity&old river as well as vertical profiles at some grid points during flood tide.  

* ##[DrifterParticleTestWeakSlip.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/DrifterParticleTestWeakSlip.ipynb)  
    
* ##[ParticleBlast.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/ParticleBlast.ipynb)  
    
    * By combining particles with different positions into one plot, it enables us to see what position the model predicts to go within +-30min and +-1km.  

* ##[RMS_restart.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/RMS_restart.ipynb)  
    
     This notebook was part of TestUVfromColdStart, just plot to see the RMS between original nowcast and that from cold start, with other conditions all the same.   

* ##[DrifterSeries.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/DrifterSeries.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to explore the surface currents of model response spatially and temporally by releasing particles within t=+-30min, l+-1km.  

* ##[VvelocityofDrifter.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/VvelocityofDrifter.ipynb)  
    
    * To calculate v velocity of the drifter, in order to compare the values with modelled results.  

* ##[CODARCurrents_more.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/CODARCurrents_more.ipynb)  
    
      * This notebook was made to look at a big picture of surface currents in the plume area with CODAR data, aiming to get some insights of the currents besides line or point comparison.  

* ##[RMS_ColdHotStart.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/RMS_ColdHotStart.ipynb)  
    
    Use june 14 nowcast restart as cold and hot start for my nowcast, by calculating the rms error, to determine the spin up days.  

* ##[MoreDrifterComparisons_SepInitialFile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/MoreDrifterComparisons_SepInitialFile.ipynb)  
    
    Same comparisons except this is more recent(Sep 24) restart file for the simulation.  

* ##[DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to further look at trajectory comparisons under different conditions. With/Without wind; Default/reduced vertical viscosity; With banks/without banks and all reduced with viscosity and not.  

* ##[SalinityQuiverShlat.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/SalinityQuiverShlat.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to look at salinity and current field difference between original and weakslip case within three days (Oct8-10, 2014)  

* ##[CODARCurrents.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/CODARCurrents.ipynb)  
    
      * This notebook was made to look at a big picture of surface currents in the plume area with CODAR data, aiming to get some insights of the currents besides line or point comparison.
