The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to reproduce drifter track with reference of Nancy's notebook with longitude ticks shown completely in the figure.  

* ##[MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook was made to compare more drifter-model results, with new river channel, reduced viscosty, no_banks and reduced viscosity&old river.  

* ##[DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to further look at trajectory comparisons under different conditions. With/Without wind; Default/reduced vertical viscosity; With banks/without banks and all reduced with viscosity and not.
