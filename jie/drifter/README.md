The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Jie for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/ReproduceDrifterTrack.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to reproduce drifter track with reference of Nancy's notebook with longitude ticks shown completely in the figure.  

* ##[MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/MoreDrifterComparisons.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook was made to compare more drifter-model results, with new river channel, reduced viscosty, no_banks and reduced viscosity&old river as well as vertical profiles at some grid points during flood tide.  

* ##[RMS_restart.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/RMS_restart.ipynb)  
    
     This notebook was part of TestUVfromColdStart, just plot to see the RMS between original nowcast and that from cold start, with other conditions all the same.   

* ##[MoreDrifterComparisons_SepInitialFile.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/MoreDrifterComparisons_SepInitialFile.ipynb)  
    
    Same comparisons except this is more recent(Sep 24) restart file for the simulation.  

* ##[DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/DrifterParticleFurther.ipynb)  
    
    * This notebook was made to further look at trajectory comparisons under different conditions. With/Without wind; Default/reduced vertical viscosity; With banks/without banks and all reduced with viscosity and not.  

* ##[CODARCurrents.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/jie/drifter/CODARCurrents.ipynb)  
    
      * This notebook was made to look at a big picture of surface currents in the plume area with CODAR data, aiming to get some insights of the currents besides line or point comparison.
