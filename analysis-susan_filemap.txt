# File map for 2-May-2016 creation of analysis-susan repo
# from the Front_Strength/, Stability_analysis/, Standing_Wave_Theory/
# directories of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-susan repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-susan_filemap.txt . ../analysis-susan
