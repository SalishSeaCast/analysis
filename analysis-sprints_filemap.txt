# File map for 2-May-2016 creation of analysis-prints repo
# from the alex/, Alyssia/, MyTrc/ directories of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-prints repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-prints_filemap.txt . ../analysis-prints
