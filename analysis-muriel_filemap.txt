# File map for 2-May-2016 creation of analysis-muriel repo
# from the Muriel/ directory of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-muriel repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-muriel_filemap.txt MEOPAR/analysis MEOPAR/analysis-muriel
