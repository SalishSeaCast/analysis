The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. Focus is on nowcast analysis.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[HYCOM - netcdf.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/HYCOM - netcdf.ipynb)  
    
    Experiemtne with HYCOM netcdf opening  

* ##[HYCOM-NOAA comparison.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/HYCOM-NOAA comparison.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare HYCOM and NOAA  

* ##[Detirmining Indices for subsetting HYCOM data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Detirmining Indices for subsetting HYCOM data.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will look up indices for subsetting the HYCOM netcdf files  

* ##[December residuals.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/December residuals.ipynb)  
    
    I donwloaded recent water level observations from this website.  
    http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/charts-cartes/obs-app/observed-eng.aspx?StationID=07795  
      
    For comparison with nowcast or forecast.  

* ##[SSH from JP.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/SSH from JP.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Understanding NOAA tides and residuals.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Understanding NOAA tides and residuals.ipynb)  
    
    Thie notebook examines the NOAA tidal predictions at Neah Bay.  

* ##[Which constituents.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Which constituents.ipynb)  
    
    Should we use constituents provided by NOAA/CHS or constituents derived from a ttide harmonic analysis?  

* ##[More on NOAA tides vs my tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/More on NOAA tides vs my tides.ipynb)  
    
    There is something funny about my tides compared to NOAA tides. What is it?  

* ##[VENUS.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/VENUS.ipynb)  
    
    Playing with pulling VENUS data.

* ##[Check Neah Bay forcing.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Check Neah Bay forcing.ipynb)  
    
    Quick peak at new Neah Bay Sea surface height forcing files.  

* ##[Nowcasts.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Nowcasts.ipynb)  
    
    Nancy's first tries for looking at nowcasts  

* ##[HYCOM.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/HYCOM.ipynb)  
    
    Practice reading in HYCOM model data.  

* ##[Model Mean Sea Level - nowcasts.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nowcast/Model Mean Sea Level - nowcasts.ipynb)  
    
    Model mean sea level - nowcasts  
      
    * What is the mean sea level of the model?  
    * Is it close to 0?   
    * Trying to determine if z=0 in the model corresponds to mean sea level.
