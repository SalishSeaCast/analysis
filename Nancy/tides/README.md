The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. These notebooks have to do with tides from the model and observations

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/tides/Tides.ipynb)  
    
* ##[Tides and background vertical viscosity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/tides/Tides and background vertical viscosity.ipynb)  
    
    Examine tidal constituents - M2/K1 elevation  
      
    M2/K1 tidal currents are also examined at the VENUS nodes.  
      
    Inference for P1 and K2 is not applied  
      
    Comparing background visc = 1e-4, 1e-5, and 1e-6.   
      
    Simulations had no weather, isoneutral lateral mixing.  

* ##[Compare DFO tides with my tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/tides/Compare DFO tides with my tides.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare DFO tides with my tides  

* ##[isoneutral_tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/tides/isoneutral_tides.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will load data, perform a tidal analyis, compare with observations, plot the results, and save the analysis in a spreadsheet.  Eight Tidal Constituents: M2, K1, O1, S2, P1, N2, Q1 and K2 are considered.  
      
    Comparing isoneutral diffusion with tuned tides (corr15)  

* ##[Compare Anne's constituents with mine.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/tides/Compare Anne's constituents with mine.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare DFO tides with my tides.   
      
    DFO tides are from Anne's 07795const.wlev constituent file. The predictions are calculated with ttide using these constituents.
