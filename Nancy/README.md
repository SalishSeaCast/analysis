* ##[Drifters.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/Drifters.ipynb)  
    
    Looking at the drifter data from Mark. Trying to determine dates and locations of releases.  

* ##[Rivers2m.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/Rivers2m.ipynb)  
    
    Quick comparison between a week long run in Dec 11-17 with rivers at different depths  
      
    1. 3m  
    2. 2m  
      
    Both simulations began with a T/S profile from the spin ups.   

* ##[crashAnalysis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/crashAnalysis.ipynb)  
    
    A code to look at the data from the crashed run. What is going wrong!  
    Looks at currents, bathymetry, and sea surface height around the crashed time step.   

* ##[bathyImage.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/bathyImage.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook creates an image of the bathymetry and coastlines. Includes:  
      
    1. Bathymetry  
    2. Location of Rivers  
    3. Storm Surge points  
      
    Other important points?  

* ##[Sea Level Pressure.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/Sea Level Pressure.ipynb)  
    
    Given the altitude of a CGRF grid cell, calculate the pressure at sea level.  

* ##[nu200_nu50.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/nu200_nu50.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook runs a comparison between the $\nu=200$ and $\nu=50$ simulations by Doug.   
      
    The focus is on currents and tracers.   

* ##[interpolation.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/interpolation.ipynb)  
    
    Just a quick notebook to play around with interpolating CGRF data into our grid.  

* ##[northAnalysis.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/northAnalysis.ipynb)  
    
    An analysis of the open boundary conditions at the north.   

* ##[mergeCompare.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/mergeCompare.ipynb)  
    
    Comparing merge-tests on Salish and Japser. A week long run to see how the differences evolve.   

* ##[Eddy viscosity.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/Eddy viscosity.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    This is a 10 day simulation with daily averaged output.
