The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. Most of the notebooks and files are used for
comaprisons of stratification data with the model.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Juan de Fuca - regional cast by cast.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/comparisons/Juan de Fuca - regional cast by cast.ipynb)  
    
    Compare a single cast from IOS observations to model.  
      
    IOS observations span many years. So, cbservations with model on day of, 7 days before and 7 days after. This can account for spring/neap variability but not interannual variabilty in discharge, winds, etc  

* ##[WOD Data-Haro.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/comparisons/WOD Data-Haro.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to play with WOD data using the wodpy package

* ##[Lighthouses.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/comparisons/Lighthouses.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to compare Race Rocks lighthouse daily salinity readings with nowcasts.  
    * http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/oceans/data-donnees/lighthouses-phares/index-eng.html  
      
      
    Lighthouse salinty readings are collected at the daytime high tide. I will compare with both nowcast and spinup daily averages.  
      
    Temperature is also available, but it is complicated by the time shift in the high tide and the diurnal vairability in temperature. I will not look at temperature for now, but could come up with a fair comparison later.

* ##[JuandeFucaBCs.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/comparisons/JuandeFucaBCs.ipynb)  
    
    Attempting to isolate data from Rob's analysis that might be useful for the Salish Sea model.  
      
    Data is from NOAA and IOS 2003-2014.(Can do a bigger date range)  

* ##[Nowcast, Spinup, Observations Comparison - JDF.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/comparisons/Nowcast, Spinup, Observations Comparison - JDF.ipynb)  
    
    Comparisons between nowcast, spinup, and observed salinity in the Strait of Juan de Fuca
