The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Stratification and tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/Stratification and tides.ipynb)  
    
    Check on a 40 day run with no stratification. This means no OBC temp/salinity, no weather and no rivers. Temp/salinity set to ocean values through whole domain.  

* ##[DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares kappa=10, smooth to kappa=20.5, not smooth  


* ##[DWR_diff1e-6_visc1e-5.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_diff1e-6_visc1e-5.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares diff=1e-6 and visc=1e-5 to base case (diff=1e-5 and visc=1e-4).  
      
    In 2D, decreasing diff made the surface layer much fresher (less mixing across strong gradients). Decreasing visc made the surface layer slightly saltier (more mixing because stronger shear??).  
      
    My thought was that decreasing both in the 3D model would somehow cancel the effect on the surface layer.  
      
    2D model had no wind.  

* ##[Rich's IOS data.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/Rich's IOS data.ipynb)  
    
    Notebook to determine the temporal and spatial coverage of IOS data that Rich has stored.  


* ##[DWR_diff1e-6.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_diff1e-6.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares diff=1e-5 to 1e-6  


* ##[DWR_isoneutral.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_isoneutral.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares isoneutral mixing to default case  


* ##[DWR_kappa10.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_kappa10.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares kappa=10 to kappa=20.5
