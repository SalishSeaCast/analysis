    Compares diff=1e-6 and visc=1e-5 with winds to diff=1e-6, visc=1e-5 with no winds.   


* ##[DWR_new_bcs_surface.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_new_bcs_surface.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares dwr_new_bcs_surface with dwr_new_bcs  
      
    Both have diff/visc 1e-6/1e-5, isoneutral, winds  
      
    dwr_new_bcs has salinity below 150m incrased by 0.3311  
      
    dwr_new_bcs_surface has salinity below 150m incrased by 0.3311 and salinity above 50m increased by 0.3311  

* ##[DWR_bbl.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_bbl.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares dwr_adv1 with dwr_base_bcs  
      
    Both have diff/visc 1e-6/1e-5, isoneutral, winds  
      
    dwr_bbl_adv1 has advecitve bbl, first option.  
      
    Similar results for dwr_bbl_diff  
      
    Almost no differences between the base case and dwr_bbl_adv2.  

* ##[Stratification and tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/Stratification and tides.ipynb)  
    
    Check on a 40 day run with no stratification. This means no OBC temp/salinity, no weather and no rivers. Temp/salinity set to ocean values through whole domain.  

* ##[DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares kappa=10, smooth to kappa=20.5, not smooth  


* ##[DWR_diff1e-6_visc1e-5.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_diff1e-6_visc1e-5.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares diff=1e-6 and visc=1e-5 to base case (diff=1e-5 and visc=1e-4).  
      
    In 2D, decreasing diff made the surface layer much fresher (less mixing across strong gradients). Decreasing visc made the surface layer slightly saltier (more mixing because stronger shear??).  
      
    My thought was that decreasing both in the 3D model would somehow cancel the effect on the surface layer.  
      
    2D model had no wind.
