The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via

Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Stratification and tides.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/Stratification and tides.ipynb)  
    
    Check on a 40 day run with no stratification. This means no OBC temp/salinity, no weather and no rivers. Temp/salinity set to ocean values through whole domain.  

* ##[DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_kappa10_smooth.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares kappa=10, smooth to kappa=20.5, not smooth  


* ##[DWR_diff1e-6.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_diff1e-6.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares diff=1e-5 to 1e-6  


* ##[DWR_isoneutral.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/strat/DWR_isoneutral.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook looks at the vertical eddy viscosity/diffusivity during a deep water renewal event in late August 2003.  
      
    Compares diff=1e-5 to 1e-6
