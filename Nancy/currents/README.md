The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. Focus is on tidal currents.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[Baroclinic tide.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/currents/Baroclinic tide.ipynb)  
    
    Analyzing the baroclinic tide at VENUS nodes  

* ##[Tidal currents .ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/currents/Tidal currents .ipynb)  
    
    An example of analyzing tidal currents.  
      


* ##[Explore recombining CODAR files.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/currents/Explore recombining CODAR files.ipynb)  
    
    Attempt at concatenating netcdf subdomain files.  

* ##[Baroclinic Tides - CODAR Region.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/currents/Baroclinic Tides - CODAR Region.ipynb)  
    
    This notebook will be used to analyze the baroclinic tides over the CODAR region.  


* ##[Baroclinic Tides - CODAR region - phase and inclination.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/analysis/raw/tip/Nancy/currents/Baroclinic Tides - CODAR region - phase and inclination.ipynb)  
    
    Another look at CODAR baroclinc tides, but focusing on the inclination and phase.  
      
    Comparing the baroclinic and barotropic ellipses.  
      
    Barotropic ellipses are found with the depth averaged currents. Depth averaging is performed over the entire water column.  
      
    Both barotropic and baroclinic were calcualted using a now cast time series Nov 26, 2014- April 26, 2015
