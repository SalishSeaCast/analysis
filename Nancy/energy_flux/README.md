The IPython Notebooks in this directory are made by Nancy for
quick sharing of results. The notebooks and script have to do with energy flux.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.ipython.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/).
Descriptions below the links are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).
