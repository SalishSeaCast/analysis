# File map for 21-Jun-2016 creation of analysis-nancy repo
# from the Nancy/ directory of the analysis repos.
# Done because the analysis repo had become annoyingly large
# and was approaching Bitbucket's 2Gb hard size limit.
#
# The following command was used to create the analysis-nancy repo:
#    cd MEOPAR/analysis
#    hg convert --filemap analysis-nancy_filemap.txt . ../analysis-nancy
